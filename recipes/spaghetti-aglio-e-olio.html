    <h2>A Simple Classic</h2>
    <p>
      No two aglio e olio recipes are alike, but this one is pretty true to the
      classic method. The key is slowly toasting the garlic slices to a perfect
      golden brown in the olive oil. If it's too light, you don't get the full
      flavor and if it's too dark it gets bitter. My advice? Do it perfectly.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound uncooked spaghetti</li>
      <li>1/2 cup olive oil</li>
      <li>6 cloves garlic,thinly sliced</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1/4 cup Italian parsley</li>
      <li>1 cup finely grated Parmagiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in
        the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm
        to the bite, about 10 to 12 minutes. Drain and transfer to a pasta bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the pasta is cooking, combine olive oil and garlic in a cold
        skillet. Cook over medium heat to slowly toast garlic, about 10 minutes.
        Reduce heat to medium-low when olive oil begins to bubble. Cook and stir
        until garlic is golden brown, about another 5 minutes. Remove from heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir red pepper flakes, salt, and black pepper into pasta. Pour in hot
        olive oil and garlic, and sprinkle on Italian parsley and half of the
        Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese; toss until combined.
      </li>
      <li>Serve pasta topped with the remaining Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.</li>
