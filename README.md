# odin-recipes

A simple website that links to some of my favorite recipes.

This is the first project of [The Odin Project's Foundations Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes).

What I've learned so far:

- How the internet works.
- Setting up my working envoronment.
- Using the command line.
- Setting up and using Git and GitHub.
- Creating web pages using HTML.
