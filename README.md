# odin-recipes

A simple website that links to some of my favorite recipes. See it on [GitHub Pages](https://lfidelino.github.io/odin-recipes/).

This is the [first project of The Odin Project's Foundations Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes). Later in the course, we're also taught [how to design the project using CSS](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-css-foundations).

What I've learned so far:

- How the internet works.
- Setting up my working envoronment.
- Using the command line.
- Setting up and using Git and GitHub.
- Creating web pages using HTML.
- Creating and linking external CSS files.
- Difference between external, internal, and inline CSS.
- Basic CSS syntax (Selector, property, value).
- CSS selectors
- CSS specificity
